# My Portfolio

A showcase of Lucian Chung's UX Design and Illustration work

This responsive portfolio site was coded by Lucian Chung(me) using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.

I tried my best to use semantic HTML and CSS class names.
I used CSS Grid (grid-template-areas) and flexbox.

##Areas for Improvement
The CSS classes admittedly get pretty messy as I wanted to customize spacing (margins and padding) for different elements, particularly on my SafSav Case Study.

I want to fine-tune the illustration pages (hover area exceed image width, and lightbox images are sometimes too tall and require scrolling).

There is CSS jitter when hovering a cursor over links at the bottom of my portfolio pages. I was unable to correct this in previous tries, but I would like to return to the problem to eliminate the jitter.
