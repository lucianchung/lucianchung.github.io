          <h2 class="title">Problem</h2>
          <p>I was requested by a client to target an unreached portion of the cloud storage market by designing a product that includes the features of saving web content, organizing content, creating content, and uploading files. I was also asked to consider including collaborative features like sharing single items, sharing groups of items, and connecting with other users for real-time collaboration in documents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution">
        <h2 class="title">Solution</h2>
          <p>SafSav is a cloud storage app with security and privacy. User research found that tech professionals desire a product that will allow them to encrypt data that they upload and keep it private from the host company. SafSav does exactly that while also performing the expected functions of a cloud storage app including uploading files, organizing files, sharing files, and more. SafSav’s design became more polished, clear, and user-friendly as it went through multiple iterations based on two rounds of Usability Testing, Preference Testing, and feedback from senior designers. </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p> Google Drive and Dropbox are big names in cloud storage while Pinterest has carved out its own niche by providing something unique. I performed a SWOT analysis of these three competitors.</p>
            <p>Google Drive and Dropbox both provide the standard features that I have been tasked with including in the app. Both products also feature a simple, minimal, text-based UI that is easy to understand and navigate. I took note of their User Flows for basic actions; they are straight-forward and not too different.</p>
            <p>The full SWOT analysis and all competitor User Flows are available at the link below.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">User Research</h3>
            <h4>What the user wants, the user gets</h4>
            <p>Next I sent out a User Survey to determine what cloud storage features users want in a product. Among other questions, I asked users to rate the desirability of features the client proposed at the start of the project. It turns out users didn’t necessarily want all of these features. With creating a manageable MVP as a goal, I decided to focus on the main features desired by users.</p>

            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfycFzlR7G7wt6S1Pv_2COq9WYEvMtfuQp4tXM6rGdEuH4R2Q/viewanalytics" target="_blank">

            </a>

            <p>Interestingly enough, 60% of survey respondents came from a tech background (IT, Web Development, Network Administration, Security Specialist…), and when asked about what additional features they wanted in cloud app storage, several responded with comments about data encryption, privacy, and other security concerns.</p>
            <p>With this product having no target audience at this point in time, it seemed like a great opportunity to focus on tech professionals who very clearly stated their desire for a cloud storage service with security and privacy. With this research, I now had a clearer direction and vision for the product. The full User Survey results can be seen here.</p>

            <p>With the User Survey and more in-depth User Personas, I could now create User Stories to determine the types of tasks to include in the product. Using percentages and statistics from user research, as well as specific comments made by potential users, I compiled lists for new and returning users ranging between 40-50 tasks. Users wanted to perform a lot of the standard tasks and collaborative tasks initially requested by the client with the important addition of data encryption. High priority tasks are displayed below with the full lists available here.</p>

            <h4>How shall I accomplish tasks?</h4>
            <p>With my User Stories, I now had specific lists of potential tasks to include in the cloud storage app. With an MVP in mind, I focused on high priority tasks first. I used pen and paper to sketch rough versions of User Flows. I also referenced User Flows I created from the Competitive Analysis to see how competitors mapped out tasks similar to those I wanted. The process for onboarding, uploading files, moving files, and sharing files isn’t that different from product to product. An important distinction we had was including extra security measures and steps.</p>
            <p>Based off of the rough sketches, I was able to create more refined User Flows using Draw.io. For onboarding, I did not include the option to sign up using social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. Because security is a major selling point of this product, I didn’t want to risk users’ data being in danger from potential security risks from social media accounts. I wanted to create a contained environment in which we and only we would determine the safety, security, and privacy for our users.</p>
            <p>All User Flows can be viewed at the link below.</p>

            <p>As with the User Flows, I started designing Wireframes with pen and paper first. I created 4-Up sketches for each screen I was going to need. I wanted to try different versions of each screen, but I also wanted there to be some sort of logical or visual consistency between each screen to make navigating the site as simple and clear for users as possible.</p>
            <p>The early rounds of digital wireframes were made using Sketch. For inspiration and reference, I looked at the screens for other cloud storage sites like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive.</p>
            <p>I designed more screens than were necessary in this first round, all of which can be seen here.</p>

However, designing these screens helped me to establish a layout that was consistent across the website. It wasn’t necessary to reiterate all of these screens in the later stages. The Prototype can be viewed here.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Style Guide</h3>
            <p>I designed a Style Guide detailing the logo usage, brand typefaces, and brand colors. All design choices including the logo design, thick typeface, and extensive use of blue were made to convey the brand values of security, strength, dependability, and professionalism. Yellow / orange was added as a contrast to the different blues that serve as the main product color. This complementary yellow / orange could be used to draw attention to CTAs or other clickable elements.</p>

            <h4>The user is never wrong.</h4>
            <p>Using Usabilityhub.com, I conducted three preference tests to get user feedback on different design elements. Though I was drawn to design choices that were unique or internally consistent, users preferred other options based on clarity and ease of use. I edited the tested design elements on the mockup to reflect the users’ most popular choices.</p>
            <p>This was a valuable experience for me to learn that user-centered design is about creating something easy to use, not necessarily what is prettiest or most creative.</p>

                <p>A senior designer reviewed the first Hi Fi Mockups and suggested some revisions. I added more yellow / orange to the overall design via borders on modal windows and more line illustrations. I adjusted the logo and headline size on the homepage to make the headline more prominent. I also added drop shadows to modal windows to help separate them from the backgrounds, and I changed the appearance of the dashboard file thumbnails and filenames to look more realistic. Lastly, I applied the changes to reflect the most popular choices from the three Preference Tests.</p>

            <p>Using the updated Mockup, I created a second Prototype in InVision. Once again, a Usability Test was conducted with three users. Though I expected this second round of testing to result in minor tweaks, some significant changes were made thanks to insightful feedback from test-takers and my lead designer. The full test report can be viewed here.</p>

            <p>All three test-takers commented on the multiple steps of the onboarding process. I followed a user’s suggestion to make a user’s email address serve as their username. This helped me to eliminate a step in the sign up process. More guidance was add for users via instructions. Back arrows were added and “Submit” was changed to “Next” to increase user-friendliness. All modal windows were moved to the “New Account” screen to make the process more unified.</p>

              <br>User Surveys proved to be very beneficial in providing a focus on security for this product. Researching User Flows for competitors was also helpful in guiding me on what screens and modal windows to create.</p>

            <p>BRANDING
              <br>Though I made a change in brand typefaces and the logo by association, the overall look and color scheme of the brand identity did not change much. Users responded positively to the line illustrations of the final design, but one user commented on how they felt fun, which is not fully in line (though not necessarily against) the desired image of security, safety, and professionalism. Feedback from senior designers, Usability Tests, and Preference Tests helped me to fine-tune visuals and specific elements of UIs.

              <h5>What didn’t work?</h5>
              <p>CONTENT STRATEGY
                <br>Perhaps the biggest changes made throughout the design process were to the sign up, upload, and sharing processes. As each of these processes has multiple steps including typing in information and selecting items, there were several places and opportunities for users to be confused. A more in-depth study of how competitors conduct similar processes could have been done, but Usability Testing was the best and most direct way to determine what worked and didn’t work for this particular product.isuals and specific elements of UIs.

            <h5>Mobile App?</h5>
            <p>Though I am satisfied with the testing of the Desktop version of SafSav, I was unable to test the Mobile version. I made edits to the Mobile version based on changes made to the Desktop version, but it is entirely possible that mobile users will have a different experience and different preferences. I would conduct Usability Tests using the Mobile version if I had more time on this project.</p>

            <h5>User input helps. A lot.</h5>
            <p>The initial project brief was a bit overwhelming in that it was an open-ended project with no clear target market. Starting with the first User Surveys, user input helped to narrow the scope of the project and point me toward data security. The rounds of Usability Testing revealed tasks, instructions, or processes that were not clear to users. This helped me to see and realize things I could not surmise on my own. The Preference Test helped me to make design decisions that were challenging to make based solely on my opinion. In a couple of Preference Tests, users made choices different than what I would make, but there was such a statistical consensus that it made it clear that I should use the user-prefered choice.</p>

            <h5>Final thoughts</h5>
            <p>It was both challenging and fun to design SafSav from start to (sort of) finish (is a living app ever truly finished?). As a task-oriented introvert, it is natural for me to work in solitude on meticulous design work, but turning to users for input throughout the process was invaluable in forcing me to step back, breath, and hear perspectives and opinions that differ from my own. Likewise, the feedback from more experienced designers was also incredibly helpful. I am certain that moving forward and working on future projects, I will continue to learn the importance of and experience the benefit of outside perspectives.</p>
