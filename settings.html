        <h1>Settings Redesign</h1>
        <p>The 30+ settings pages in our app had very inconsistent UI and UX. Though a complete overhaul of our settings pages could not be prioritized from the business, a group of designers came up with an updated, consistent design pattern that we have been applying to the app little by little.</p>

        <h3>Inconsistent UI</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Standard users have access to seven different settings pages, while admins have access to 24 additional pages, several of these with multiple tabs. Many of these 30+ pages were built by different teams at different times, so there are many inconsistencies in the UI and information architecture. Font styles for page titles, subsection headings, and field labels vary as do the tone and language for microcopy. In addition, older pages may use styles and UI components from an older design system while newer pages use new components that look and behave differently (for example, checkboxes with labels may differ). In short, a user may have a completely different experience from one settings page to another, making it confusing and more time-consuming to complete their tasks.</p>

        <h3>Inconsistent Saving Pattern</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Along with the aforementioned inconsistencies with UI, some settings have different mechanisms for saving, even if they involve the same user input. For example, some select inputs and checkboxes trigger a save automatically once they are updated, while other select inputs and checkboxes require the user to click a save button.</p>
            <p>In one extreme example, there is a page with three subsections, each with its own save button. An internal user from professional services was struggling to help a customer who wanted to update a given setting in the first subsection on the page. Both the customer and internal user were updating the setting, then scrolling to the bottom of the screen to select the save button for the third subsection. The setting was not updated because both users were scrolling past the relevant save button for the first subsection. In their defense, the three subsections are not clearly delineated.</p>

To continue the discussion of inconsistent saving patterns above, though many settings  trigger a toast (flash) message when updated, some settings do not. In these instances, it is unclear to users if their recent changes have taken effect or not.</p>

            <p>The team of four designers shared our comparative analysis findings and discussed what elements we liked from different applications. We discussed the problems with our current settings pages and came to a general agreement on what we wanted to address and improve. We then separately worked on designs for updates to different settings pages. We each chose pages with which we had some familiarity, and made sure that we included the different types of inputs found on all existing settings pages. We met weekly, sharing our designs and giving each other feedback. We continued to refine our designs as we were inspired by each other’s work and our weekly reviews.</p>

        <h3>Single, Flexible Pattern</h3>
          <div>
            <p>We agreed upon a pattern where a given setting is contained in a box with an outline to clearly separate it from other settings. This container includes a title, a description, the current status of the setting (if applicable), and an element for the user to interact with. This pattern enables us to use consistent microcopy, especially for the setting status and edit button. We are also able to support different input methods with this UI. We apply a max width to the container, so that the interactable element won’t be too far from the microcopy on larger monitors.</p>

        <h3>Reception and Implementation</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Because this project was initiated by the design team vs. being a product feature, we did not gather metrics to measure success. We have received very positive feedback internally from internal users and even developers who have built this new UI.</p>
            <p>It is also worth noting that due to the number of our settings pages and other business priorities, we are still in the process of implementing this new design pattern. Most of our settings pages still have the older, inconsistent UI. However, whenever we implement new settings, we use the new pattern. And we are currently in the middle of an ongoing initiative to rebuild a lot of the older pages in our app, so we have been applying this new pattern whenever the opportunity arises, little by little.</p>
